# Founder Notes

This folder contains qualitative insights from founders and leadership about the market, customers, and product.

## Purpose

Some knowledge exists only in people's heads. Capture it here:
- Market dynamics that aren't in data
- Customer relationships and history
- Product vision and roadmap context
- Competitive intelligence
- Lessons learned

## How to Capture

### Audio Notes
Have founders record voice memos about:
- What they know about the market
- Why customers buy
- What's changed recently
- Competitive dynamics

Transcribe and save as markdown files.

### Interview Format

Schedule 30-60 minutes with founders/leadership. Topics to cover:

1. **Market Understanding**
   - What's happening in the market right now?
   - What trends are you seeing?
   - What's changing?

2. **Customer Knowledge**
   - Who are our best customers and why?
   - What makes someone a bad fit?
   - What do customers say they love about us?

3. **Competitive Landscape**
   - Who do we compete with?
   - Why do we win? Why do we lose?
   - What's our unique advantage?

4. **Product Context**
   - What problems are we solving?
   - What's on the roadmap that's relevant to sales?
   - What should sales NOT promise?

## File Format

Save notes as dated markdown files:
- `YYYY-MM-DD-founder-market-update.md`
- `YYYY-MM-DD-competitive-intel.md`
- `YYYY-MM-DD-customer-insight-[topic].md`

## Using This Knowledge

When starting a campaign, ask Claude:
> "Review the founder notes for any insights relevant to [segment/campaign]. What context should inform our messaging?"

When something changes:
> "Add this new market context to the founder notes and update any affected hypotheses or segment insights."
