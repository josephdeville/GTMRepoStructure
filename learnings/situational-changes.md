### Search-Based Research
Use serp.dev, OpenWebNinja, or similar for:

### Prompts for Research

**Finding triggers for target accounts:**
> "For each account in the target list, search for recent news about:
> - Funding announcements
> - Leadership changes
> - Expansion news
> - Product launches
> Return any situational changes detected with dates and sources."

**Validating trigger signals:**
> "Review our closed-won deals and identify what publicly identifiable changes were happening at those businesses when they were closing. Categorize by trigger type and calculate correlation with deal success."
