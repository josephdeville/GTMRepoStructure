Master list of hypotheses about your GTM motion. Updated as campaigns validate or invalidate each hypothesis.

## Validated Hypotheses

Hypotheses confirmed by campaign data.

### Targeting

| ID | Hypothesis | Validated By | Confidence | Notes |
|----|------------|--------------|------------|-------|
| T1 | [e.g., Companies 90 days post-Series A are most receptive] | Campaign XYZ | High | 3x reply rate vs. baseline |
| T2 | | | | |

### Messaging

| ID | Hypothesis | Validated By | Confidence | Notes |
|----|------------|--------------|------------|-------|
| M1 | [e.g., Leading with ROI numbers outperforms pain-focused messaging for CFOs] | Campaign XYZ | Medium | 2x meeting rate |
| M2 | | | | |

### Timing

| ID | Hypothesis | Validated By | Confidence | Notes |
|----|------------|--------------|------------|-------|
| TI1 | [e.g., Tuesday-Wednesday outreach performs best] | Multiple | High | Consistent across 5 campaigns |
| TI2 | | | | |

## Hypotheses to Test

Untested hypotheses for future campaigns.

| ID | Hypothesis | Source | Priority | Proposed Test |
|----|------------|--------|----------|---------------|
| H1 | [e.g., Engineering leaders respond better to technical content] | Transcript analysis | High | Run A/B in next DevTools campaign |

## How to Update

1. **After each campaign:** Review results and categorize hypotheses
2. **Move validated hypotheses** to the Validated section with evidence
3. **Move invalidated hypotheses** to the Invalidated section
4. **Add new hypotheses** discovered during campaigns to "To Test"
5. **Update confidence levels** as more data comes in
